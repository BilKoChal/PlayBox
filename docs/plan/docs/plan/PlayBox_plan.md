## 4. Phases & Sub-Phases

### Phase 0 — Rapid Prototype (3 Games, Core Platform)

**Goal:** A demonstrable, runnable prototype with 3 games, basic UI, auto-deploy to GitHub Pages, and Windows/Android builds.

**After Phase 0, the user has:**
- Working game catalog with 3 playable games
- GitHub Pages deployment on push to main
- Windows .exe/.msi and Android .apk in GitHub Releases
- Complete game interface contract validated with 3 engines
- Basic PWA (installable, offline shell)

#### 0.1 — Project Scaffolding & Configuration ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-28)
- [x] Initialize Git repo with `main` branch
- [x] Create Vite + React + TypeScript project
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS with PlayBox design tokens (candy palette, Nunito/Quicksand fonts)
- [x] Configure ESLint + Prettier
- [x] Create project folder structure (src/components, src/hooks, src/games, etc.)
- [x] Configure `vite.config.ts` with code splitting (`manualChunks` for engines)
- [x] Create `src/types/game.ts` with canonical `PlayBoxGame` interface
- [x] Set up `src-tauri/` (Tauri v2 config, Cargo.toml)
- [x] Set up `android/` (Capacitor config, build.gradle)
- [x] Create `manifest.json` for PWA
- [x] Create `index.html` with font preconnects
- [x] Write `scripts/generate-game-registry.ts`
- [x] Write `scripts/copy-404.js` for SPA routing on GitHub Pages
- **Note:** Also created lib stubs (audio, storage, platform, fullscreen, search), contexts (Theme, Sound, Game), and game-registry helpers. Kaboom is deprecated — consider KAPLAY migration in Phase 1. See [worklog](worklogs/1%20-%20worklog.md).

#### 0.2 — Platform Shell (Basic UI) ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-28)
- [x] Build `App.tsx` with React Router + ThemeProvider + SoundProvider
- [x] Build `Header` component (logo, search placeholder, sound/theme toggles)
- [x] Build `HomePage` with responsive game grid (grid-cols-1 to grid-cols-4)
- [x] Build `GameCard` component (thumbnail, title, category dot, difficulty stars, favorite heart)
- [x] Build `GameWrapper` component (the bridge between React and PlayBoxGame interface)
- [x] Build `GamePage` with lazy loading via dynamic imports
- [x] Implement basic `ThemeContext` (light/dark toggle with localStorage persistence)
- [x] Implement basic `SoundContext` (global mute toggle)
- [x] Implement basic routing: `/` (catalog), `/game/:gameId` (play)
- **Note:** Also built UI components (Button, Toggle, SearchBar, Badge, Modal), feedback components (Toast, ScoreDisplay, EmptyState), pages (Favorites, Settings), hooks (useFavorites, useFullscreen, useSearch), and Footer. Tauri API accessed via runtime `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` to prevent build errors. See [worklog](worklogs/2%20-%20worklog.md).

#### 0.3 — Shared Services (Core) ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-28)
- [x] Implement `SoundManager` class (Web Audio API, 3 categories, global mute, lazy init)
- [x] Implement `ScoreTracker` with Dexie.js (IndexedDB, score submission, top-10 query)
- [x] Implement `FavoritesManager` (localStorage, max 20, toggle)
- [x] Implement `FullscreenService` (web Fullscreen API + Tauri + Capacitor abstraction)
- [x] Implement platform detection (`src/lib/platform.ts`)
- **Note:** Also created ScoreFormatter, PlayerNameManager, SettingsManager, procedural sound generation, online/offline and preference change event systems. See [worklog](worklogs/3%20-%20worklog.md).

#### 0.4 — MVP Games (3 Games) ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-28)
- [x] **Sudoku** (Canvas, Logic/Puzzle) — Full implementation with 3 difficulties, scoring by time, AI solver for validation
- [x] **Snake** (Kaboom, Arcade) — Full implementation with 3 speeds, scoring by length, sound effects
- [x] **Breakout** (Kaboom, Arcade) — Full implementation with 3 difficulties, scoring, collision detection
- [x] Each game implements `PlayBoxGame` interface with metadata, mount, unmount, pause, resume
- [x] Generate thumbnails for each game (AI-generated via z-ai-generate)
- [x] Register all 3 in game registry
- **Note:** Sudoku uses different grid sizes per difficulty (4×4, 6×6, 9×9). Snake uses wall wrap on Easy for kid-friendliness. Breakout uses direct touch-to-paddle mapping. All games use procedural sounds only (no audio files). Kaboom games use `global: false` mode with cleanup via empty scene navigation. See [worklog](worklogs/4%20-%20worklog.md).

#### 0.5 — CI/CD Pipeline ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-28)
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with 5 jobs:
  1. `test` — Lint, type-check, build smoke test (runs on PR + push)
  2. `deploy-pages` — Build Vite → deploy to GitHub Pages via Actions (push to main only)
  3. `build-windows` — Tauri v2 build → .exe + .msi artifacts (push to main only)
  4. `build-android` — Capacitor build → .apk artifact (push to main only)
  5. `release` — Aggregate all artifacts → GitHub Release (push to main only)
- [x] Configure GitHub Pages source as "GitHub Actions" (documented, user must set)
- [x] Fix `scripts/copy-404.js` for ESM compatibility (require → import)
- [x] Build verified locally: tsc 0 errors, vite build 83 modules in 4.55s
- **Note:** User must configure GitHub repo settings before first push: (1) Pages → Source = "GitHub Actions", (2) Actions → Workflow permissions = "Read and write". No secrets required for MVP. See [task plan](tasks/5%20-%20CI_CD%20Pipeline.md).

#### 0.6 — PWA & Offline ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-28)
- [x] Configure `vite-plugin-pwa` with Workbox (generateSW mode, autoUpdate)
- [x] Set up precache for shell (HTML, CSS, JS, icons — 31 entries, ~1302 KB)
- [x] Set up cache-on-play for game engine chunks, game chunks, thumbnails, Google Fonts
- [x] Create offline fallback via `navigateFallback: 'index.html'` (SPA routing offline)
- [x] Create offline banner component (amber bar: "You are offline — cached games are still playable!")
- [x] Generate PWA icons (192, 512, maskable variants) via z-ai-generate + PIL resize
- [x] Generate favicon.ico from icon source
- [x] Register service worker in `main.tsx` (production only, with update listener)
- [x] Remove static `public/manifest.json` (vite-plugin-pwa generates `manifest.webmanifest`)
- [x] Update `index.html` with full PWA meta tags (apple-touch-icon, mobile-web-app-capable, etc.)
- [x] Create `useOnlineStatus` hook for online/offline detection
- **Note:** Service worker precaches all app shell assets. Game engines (Kaboom/Phaser) and game chunks are cached on first play via runtime caching strategies. Google Fonts cached with 1-year expiry. See [worklog](worklogs/6%20-%20worklog.md).

**Phase 0 Milestone:** PlayBox is live at `https://owner.github.io/playbox/` with 3 games, installable as PWA, with Windows and Android builds available in GitHub Releases.

The critical path is the sequence of phases that determines the shortest possible completion time:

```
Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3
```

All phases are sequential because each builds on the previous one:

- **Phase 0** must complete first because it establishes the game interface contract, platform shell, and CI/CD pipeline that all subsequent phases depend on.
- **Phase 1** depends on Phase 0's infrastructure to add features and games.
- **Phase 2** depends on Phase 1's feature set to add optimization and testing at scale.
- **Phase 3** depends on Phase 2's stable foundation to add the remaining games and sign production builds.

### Internal Phase Dependencies

Within each phase, sub-phases have their own dependencies:

**Phase 0:**
```
0.1 (Scaffolding) → 0.2 (Shell) → 0.3 (Services) → 0.4 (Games) → 0.5 (CI/CD) → 0.6 (PWA)
```
All sub-phases are sequential because each depends on the previous one's output.

**Phase 1:**
```
1.1 (Search/Filter) ─┐
1.2 (Scores/Favs)  ──┤──→ 1.3 (UI Polish) → 1.4 (Games) → 1.5 (Cross-Platform) → 1.6 (Utilities)
1.3 (UI Polish)    ──┘
```
1.1 and 1.2 can proceed in parallel. 1.3 depends on both. 1.4–1.6 are sequential.

**Phase 2:**
```
2.1 (Perf) ──────┐
2.2 (A11y) ──────┤──→ 2.3 (Testing) → 2.4 (Games) → 2.5 (Assets)
2.3 (Testing) ───┘
```
2.1 and 2.2 can proceed in parallel. 2.3 depends on both. 2.4–2.5 are sequential.

**Phase 3:**
```
3.1 (Games) → 3.2 (Signing) → 3.3 (Polish) → 3.4 (Release)
```
All sequential. Signing must happen before final polish verification. Release is last.

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Phaser 3 Bundle Size
**Impact:** High — 350KB gzipped chunk that must load before any Phaser game starts.  
**Likelihood:** Certain — Phaser's monolithic architecture makes tree-shaking nearly impossible.  
**Mitigation:** (1) Phaser is a shared chunk — loaded once, cached for all Phaser games. (2) Cache-on-play PWA strategy means Phaser is only downloaded when a user first plays a Phaser game. (3) Only 11 of 55 games use Phaser (20%). (4) Investigate Phaser Lite or custom builds for future optimization.

### Risk 2: Kaboom.js Cleanup Issues
**Impact:** Medium — Memory leaks when switching away from Kaboom games.  
**Likelihood:** Likely — Kaboom has no official `destroy()` method.  
**Mitigation:** (1) Navigate to empty cleanup scene + null context on unmount. (2) `GameWrapper` forcibly clears `container.innerHTML` as safety net. (3) Memory leak tests in CI (5 mount/unmount cycles with heap growth assertion). (4) Consider contributing `destroy()` upstream to Kaboom.

### Risk 3: Android WebView Performance
**Impact:** Medium — Kaboom and Phaser games may run slowly on older Android devices.  
**Likelihood:** Possible — WebView performance varies widely across Android versions and manufacturers.  
**Mitigation:** (1) Target minSdk 24 (Android 7.0+) for reasonable WebView baseline. (2) Test on low-end device early in Phase 1. (3) Add "reduce animations" setting for low-performance devices. (4) Canvas games (51%) run well on any WebView.

### Risk 4: CI/CD Build Times
**Impact:** Medium — With 55 games, Vite build + Tauri Rust compilation + Gradle Android build could take 15+ minutes.  
**Likelihood:** Likely — Build time grows with game count.  
**Mitigation:** (1) Caching: Node (npm cache), Rust (swatinem/rust-cache), Gradle (cache: gradle). (2) `dorny/paths-filter` to skip unchanged game tests. (3) Parallel jobs for Windows/Android. (4) Target: <6 minutes warm build, <15 minutes cold build.

### Risk 5: Scope Creep (55 Games)
**Impact:** High — 55 games is a massive scope. Each game needs implementation, testing, assets, and maintenance.  
**Likelihood:** Likely — Especially with an AI agent doing the development.  
**Mitigation:** (1) Phased approach: 3 → 15 → 30 → 55 games. (2) Prioritize Easy-complexity games first (42% of catalog). (3) Standardized interface means each game is independent — no cross-game dependencies. (4) Each game is testable in isolation. (5) Automated registry means zero-config game addition.

### Risk 6: PWA Cache Invalidation
**Impact:** Medium — Users may see stale game versions after updates.  
**Likelihood:** Possible — Service worker caching can be tricky to get right.  
**Mitigation:** (1) Use `vite-plugin-pwa` with `registerType: 'autoUpdate'` — service worker updates automatically. (2) Version game assets with content hashes (Vite default). (3) Add "Update available" toast notification. (4) Test cache invalidation in CI.

### Risk 7: Cross-Platform Consistency
**Impact:** Medium — Games may behave differently in browser vs Tauri WebView vs Android WebView.  
**Likelihood:** Possible — Different WebView implementations have subtle differences.  
**Mitigation:** (1) Platform abstraction layer (`src/lib/platform.ts`) normalizes differences. (2) Test on all 3 platforms in Phase 1.5 and Phase 2.5. (3) Use `capacitor.config.ts` `androidScheme: 'https'` for secure context. (4) CSP policy tested across all platforms.

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Initialize the repository** — Create the Git repo, scaffold the Vite + React + TypeScript project, and push to GitHub.
2. **Define the `PlayBoxGame` interface** — Write `src/types/game.ts` as the canonical contract. Every game and all platform code depends on this.
3. **Build the platform shell** — Get `HomePage`, `GameCard`, `GameWrapper`, and `GamePage` working with a single placeholder game.
4. **Implement the first game (Sudoku)** — Validate the full pipeline: metadata → lazy import → mount → play → score → unmount.
5. **Set up CI/CD** — Get auto-deploy to GitHub Pages working first, then add Windows and Android builds.
6. **Iterate** — Follow the Phase 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 roadmap, validating at each milestone.
